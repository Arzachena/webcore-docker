Edit the docker-compose.yml Change the two MY_CN instances
from "webcore" to the FQDN or servername you want your instance to have,
or just leave it at "webcore". You can also edit the locale in the openssl
command in the Dockerfile. Nothing will break if you don't, but the locale
of your crt will say "Portland, OR".
docker-compose up -d

OR 

docker build --build-arg MY_CN=webcore .
docker run bmcgair/webcore-docker:latest

In both cases your crt will be self-signed, so most browsers will complain a bit,
but hubitat doesn't seem to mind, and traffic to the WebCoRE instance 
will still be encrypted.
