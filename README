Edit the docker-compose.yml Change the two MY_CN instances
from "webcore" to the FQDN or servername you want your instance to have,
or just leave it at "webcore". Either way you should then add an entry in
your local /etc/hosts mapping this name to the ip of your docker host.

You can also edit the locale in the openssl command in the Dockerfile. Nothing
will break if you don't, but the locale of your crt will say "Portland, OR".

docker-compose up -d

Your crt will be self-signed, so most browsers will complain a bit,
but hubitat doesn't seem to mind.
